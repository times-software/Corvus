Introduction

Corvus is a Python package designed for managing workflows of physical
simulations that span multiple scientific codes. It is intended to accommodate a
spectrum of users. At one end, a beginner user only interested in running a
specific type of calculation can be provided with a pre-built workflow and
concern themselves only with modifying their input; at the other end, an expert
user can utilize the internal tools to build their own custom scientific
workflows. The Python language allows us to provide a tool that can act as an
executable program and an accessible library, satisfying either type of user.

Corvus primary goal, is to provide a tool that does not require users to develop
their own workflows. To this end, Corvus is a general software framework aimed
at a broad user base that enables the development of scientific workflows,
with particular focus on the interfacing of non-databound, computationally
intensive, heterogeneous scientific codes.

Corvus philosophy:

General: The Corvus framework is able to encode a broad range of scientific
workflows. It abstracts as many operations as possible into reusable modules
(Handlers) that can be interconnected by means of data-sharing.

Intelligent: The Corvus framework is capable of making intelligent decisions and
checks, thus reducing the burden on beginner users. Workflows are built solely
from established input dependencies of the supported scientific codes.

Extensible: The Corvus framework supports growth through modularity, connecting
parts requiring minimal interfacing. This allows developers to build certain
sections without affecting others.

Sustainable: Corvus development is hosted on GitHub, thus facilitating
collaboration between developers. To maximize sustainability, Corvus is divided
into two layers: A high-level layer containing the highly-abstracted operations,
and a low-level one that localizes the code-dependence.

Portable: Given that it is developed in Python, Corvus is, for the most part,
platform-independent. Platform dependence is localized at or below the point of
contact between the Corvus framework and the codes that it interconnects. This
means that only the external executables and the way they are executed depend on
the platform.

Easy for users: The input syntax in Corvus is as independent from the
interconnected codes as possible, unifying properties and parameters that are
common to many codes. The input is heavily biased towards "physical", easy to
understand input parameters. It minimizes the need to input "expert" control
parameters by aggressively using defaults and smart automated decision making.

Easy for developers: The separation of the framework into high- and low-level
layers facilitates development for both core framework developers as well as
casual developers that want to extend the capabilities of the framework to new
workflows.

Corvus Structure

Corvus is designed around two main layers: (1) a top level infrastructure that
interacts with the user and executes the various steps defined in the workflow,
and (2) lower level code that interacts with the external scientific software to
produce the desired output that is then translated into the physical properties
required by the workflow. This stratification allows Corvus to separate the
implementation details specific to each external software package from the
general workflow controls, to permit generic and modular workflow structures
that can handle a wide variety of calculations. 

Corvus relies on workflows consisting of a sequence of modular steps, each
providing part of the information needed to compute a desired physical property.
These individual steps, or "Exchanges", take a set of input properties, pass it
down to external programs which then pass newly calculated output properties
back up to a central "System" database. The code that deals with the external
software is separated into independent components, or "Handlers", that are
specific to each external scientific program.


================================================================================

How to obtain Corvus

At present, the stable version of Corvus can be obtained by contacting the
developers at feff@uw.edu. In the near future it will also be available for
download from the Feff or TIMES websites.

Alternatively, developers can get access to Corvus by cloning its GitHub repo
with

git clone https://github.com/feffgroup/Corvus.git

after being accepted as a Corvus developer.

How to install Corvus

After downloading the code, the Corvus directory should look like:

################################################################################
MANIFEST.in
README.md
bin/
corvus.conf.cori
corvus.conf.edison
corvus.conf.example
doc/
examples/
setup.py
src/
################################################################################

To install Corvus follow these steps:

1) Copy the "corvus.conf.example" to "corvus.conf" and open it. It should look
like this:

################################################################################
[Executables]
dmdw     : <path to dmdw dir>
feff     : <path to feff executables dir>
feffrixs : <path to feff RIXS executables dir>
abinit   : <path to abinit executables dir>
nwchem   : <path to nwchem executables dir>
orca     : <path to orca executables dir>
gaussian : <path to gaussian executables dir>
vasp     : <path to vasp executables dir>

[Defaults]
prefix      : Corvus
inputsuffix : .inp
savesuffix  : .nest
checkpoints : off
parallelrun :
################################################################################

(Alternatively, the "corvus.conf.cori" or "corvus.conf.edison" used in the Cori
and Edison systems at NERSC can be used as starting points.)

Replace the "<value>" entries with the paths to the corresponding executables.
If desired, change the defaults for run prefix, input and save suffixes. By
default Corvus does not checkpoint, but this can be turned on here. In addition,
a default can be also set for the parallel run commend used in the target
system. This facilitates the submission of jobs for users.

2) Use the Python setup utility do:

python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/corvus

where "/path/to/corvus" is the path where the scripts, modules, examples and
documentation will be installed.

3) To make Corvus visible to Python, add the

/path/to/corvus/lib/python2.7/site-packages

value to the Python path in the appropriate way for the target system.

4) In the same way, add the

/path/to/corvus/bin

directory to the systems executable path. This makes the "run-corvus" script
visible throughout the system.

================================================================================

Input Structure

The input of Corvus is very simple: All input variables (i.e. tokens) have the
following possible structures:

################################################################################
! comment
token1 {value} # comment
token2 {value value value}
token3 {
        value  # comment
        value  ! comment
       }
token4  value
################################################################################

Each token can be followed by a single value, or by a group of values enclosed
in curly brackets. Any input in a line after the "!" or "#" characters is
considered a comment.

Depending on the input variable, the values must have the following possible
types:

Integer: Any integer number, for example, 42, -10, 0, 1

Float:   Any real number, for example, -10.0, 20.5, -1.0e+10

Boolean: A logical value with the possible values of 0, 1, True, False, .true.,
         .false., T and F

String:  A string is a collection of alphanumeric characters without any spaces,
	 basically any other value that is not an Integer, Float or Boolean.

In addition to these types, Corvus has two other possible types that are
important for developers as they affect the internal handling of the data:

Auto:    This type indicates that Corvus will attempt to determine the type of
         the data automatically.

Pass:    The data is passed to the Handlers "as is" (i.e. as a string with
	 exactly the same formatting that is put between the curly brackets).


The following are all the currently available input variables in Corvus.

dmdw.ioflag:

Description:
 Set the amount of output printed by DMDW. Possible values are:
   0: Terse, prints out only the desired result (s^2, u^2, etc).
   1: Verbose, prints out the pole frequencies and weights, as well as
      estimates of the Einstein temperatures for each path.
 Please refer to the DMDW section of the Feff manual for further details.

 NOTE: The current format described below is temporary for compatibility with
 previous versions of Corvus. This will be changed to "Integer" in the future.

Format:
dmdw.ioflag {
 Pass
}

Default:
None

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dmdw.nlanc:

Description:
 Set the number of Lanczos poles (i. e. iterations) in DMDW. Larger values
 usually improve convergence of the target quantity. However, the number of
 poles should not exceed the dimensions of the subspace spanned by the
 projection of the path into the appropriate eigenmodes of the Hessian. This
 means that this variable should always be less than 3*N-6, where N is the
 number of atoms in the system. In practice, a value of 6-8 is sufficient to
 obtain converged mean square relative displacements (MSRD, or s^2) for EXAFS.
 For crystallographic mean square displacements (MSD, or u^2) at least 16 poles
 are usually needed. Please refer to the DMDW section of the Feff manual for
 further details.

 NOTE: The current format described below is temporary for compatibility with
 previous versions of Corvus. This will be changed to "Integer" in the future.

Format:
dmdw.nlanc {
 Pass
}

Default:
None

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dmdw.paths:

Description:
 Set up the path descriptors that will generate the list of paths for which
 properties will be calculated. The list has the following form:
   <Number of descriptors>
     <Descriptor 1>
     <Descriptor 2>
    .
    .

 Each descriptor has the form:
   <Number of atoms in path> <Atom index 1> ... <Max. path length (Ang)>

 The atom indices can take the value 0 which acts as a wildcard for all atoms
 in the system.

 Examples:

 2
 2 1 0   3.0
 3 2 0 5 6.0

 This section defines 2 paths descriptors. The first one generates all paths
 with two atoms, starting in atom 1 and going to all other atoms in the
 systems, but subject to a maximum effective path length of 3.0 Ang. The
 second one generates all paths with three atoms, starting in atom 2 and
 ending in atom 5, while passing trhough all other atoms in the system, but
 with a maximum effective length of 6.0 Ang.
 Using the same syntax atoms can be selected to compute their u^2. For example
 the paths section

 1
 1 0 0.0

 will produce u^2 for all atoms in the system. Please refer to the DMDW
 section of the Feff manual for further details.

 NOTE: The current format described below is temporary for compatibility with
 previous versions of Corvus.

Format:
dmdw.paths {
 Pass
}

Default:
None

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dmdw.tempgrid:

Description:
 Set up the temperature grid to compute the thermal properties in DMDW. It has
 the following form:

   <Number of temperature> <Min. temp.> <Max. temp.>

 If the number of desired temperatures is just one, the maximum temperature
 input is not needed. Please refer to the DMDW section of the Feff manual for
 further details.

 NOTE: The current format described below is temporary for compatibility with
 previous versions of Corvus.

Format:
dmdw.tempgrid {
 Pass
}

Default:

 run it. You can do the whole run in sequence, one module at a time, but you must run all
 modules sequentially. Do not skip modules: CONTROL 1 1 1 0 0 1 is incorrect. The default
 is CONTROL 1 1 1 1 1 1, i.e. run all 6 modules. ipot controls modules atomic, pot and screen;
 ifms controls modules fms and mkgtr; and iff2x controls modules ff2x, sfconv, and eels. The
 ldos module is not affected by the CONTROL card ; it is activated using the corresponding
 LDOS card.

feff.overlap:

Description:

 OVERLAP ipot

 The OVERLAP card can be used to construct approximate overlapped atom potentials when
 atomic coordinates are not known or specified. If the atomic positions are listed following the
 ATOMS card, the OVERLAP card is not needed. feff9.6 will stop if both the ATOMS and
 OVERLAP cards are used. The OVERLAP card contains the potential index of the atom being
 overlapped and is followed by a list specifying the potential index, number of atoms of a given
 type to be overlapped and their distance to the atom being overlapped. The examples below
 demonstrate the use of an OVERLAP list. This option can be useful for initial single scattering
 XAFS calculations in complex materials where very little is known about the structure.
